I've started to understand the Agile workflow, but I wouldn't say that I've fully understood it quite yet.
The only real way to make progress is to keep going.

As stated previously, I was in charge of teaching our team about it and Github. I'd say that process was successful.
Since our work this week focused mostly on creating drafts for our UI and UML, I have yet to be able to see
just how successful the process was. Next week will have a lot more coding, so we'll see what happens then.

Our first Scrum has come and gone, and I will admit that I have not actively done much for our team's use of scrum.
I have participated in the parts related to it, of course, but it would be good for me to try to take a slightly more
active role.

During the week, I was assigned to help design a preliminary UML diagram for our program structure, a process in which
I made sure I was an active participant, in no small part due to my coworkers(?) trusting my knowledge in program design.
We also had our first team reflection during the week, where I helped to clarify for the team what the assignment
expected of us. I imagine that this "role" might continue into the foreseeable future.
