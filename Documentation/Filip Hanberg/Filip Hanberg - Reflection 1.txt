As the team has not yet made any concrete decision regarding what we will be creating during the project,
I feel that I can't name any concrete goals regarding, say, "learning more about programming topic X".
This is, of course, also not the objective of this course.

I want to improve my ability to work with a team, with discussions/meetings as a focus.
This is because it is an area in which I often find myself lacking.
This improvement can come about by being more active during our meetings.
