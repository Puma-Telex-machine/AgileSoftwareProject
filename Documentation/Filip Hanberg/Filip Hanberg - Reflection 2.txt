Last week's reflection was simple, I'll admit.
At the same time, there really was not much to talk about regarding that first week.

There is not anything in particular that I want to learn or understand better, so I suppose that "the nature of an Agile
workflow in practice" will have to do; this is something I will naturally begin (and actively strive to) understand
over the course of our first actual week of Scrum.

As I have been chosen by the team to take special note over our use of Git and Github, I feel that it is my responsibility
to ensure that all team members have a grasp over the function of these two services. We have, as a team, decided that this
will, in part, be done during the self study week. I'll be preparing a sort of quickstart-style guide for git (this will
likely consist of links to already existing material) as well as making a proposal for our standard regarding git-commits
and pull requests (essentially the code documentation side of our DoD).

We have not yet began working with Scrum.

Apart from actively taking part in the discussion regarding our deliverables, I performed some minor spellchecks and rephrasing
of our project scope. Not sure how much else I can write on this topic, for now.
