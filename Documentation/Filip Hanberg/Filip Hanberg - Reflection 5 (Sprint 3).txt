During the course of this week, I have learned about loading and saving text files in java.
Other than that, I can't really point towards anything in particular that I have learned/ will have to learn other than
the Agile workflow, a process which is progressing fairly steadily.

As mentioned last week, it feels like I've been placed into something like a teaching/guiding position when it comes
to coding in Java, which has now also extended to being asked to look over and try to solve bugs, particularly when
it has some relation to code that I myself has written, but sometimes also in more separate cases. Overall, I'd say
that it is fitting work, and I will continue to do it. There's not many changes that need to be made yet.
As one of the two people placed in the team's github-focused role, I have also been working on giving advice on the git-usage
of the team. Again, can't see much that would need changing at the moment.

Similarly to last week, I have not done any standout work when it comes to our use of Scrum, mostly because I have not found
it to be particularly necessary.

As previously mentioned, I have developed a system for saving and loading diagram files for the program, which notably
allows the user to theoretically create a valid diagram using a text editor to be loaded into the program.
Since this part of the program will require updating whenever the necessary data to be saved/loaded changes, I will
likely continue to work on this system alongside any other user stories we develop.

My contribution to our team reflection remains as it has been previously, which I feel is perfectly fine for now.
