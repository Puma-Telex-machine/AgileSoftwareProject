Github continues its attempts to frustrate me, but I do feel like I've gotten a somewhat better grasp of the whole thing.
Overall the topic of "what I want to learn" feels like a weird topic to me. Most of my learning is done in fairly short
bursts, so it's difficult for me to pinpoint a specific topic unless it's already on my mind. Sorry about that.

My work on teaching others continues as previously described and unhindered, and I'm fine with that.

We've reshuffled our approach to work a little, in that we now have greater contact with whomever we're working with
to complete a user story rather than communicating primarily within the frontend/backend teams. This was probably a better
idea overall, since it allows conversations to be more focused on topics relevant for me/us. My own contribution to our team's
use of Scrum has stayed largely the same.

I've definitely done more work this week than i did last week, mostly due to my job for the week being the setup for an
undo/redo system for the program as well as implementing the ability to load in pre-established template files into the user's
current work. While both of these made for interesting work, they weren't able to be properly finished in time due to issues
in integrating the frontend with the backend. (this is somewhat of a running theme in the project)
Also, there's a whole bunch of bugs to fix, so this next week will be fun. I have no particular complaints or proposals for
improvement regarding my contributions to the project.
