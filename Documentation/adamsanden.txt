	
	Week 1.

	What do I want to learn or understand better?
	How to efficiently divide the workload considering that we all have different backgrounds and experiences


	How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	Not easy to say, but in general by listening and giving advice and sharing thoughts in areas that I’m familiar with.


	What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	This far, none.


	What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	Participating in meetings and discussions.

	


	Week 2.

	What do I want to learn or understand better?
	In the end, we decided to make a program for making UML diagrams. As it was quite some time since I used it, I’m not completely up to date with some things of it. Also, 		learning more about git would be great since I have no previous experience of it.


	How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	One way could be by sharing information that I myself find useful. Even if a group member knows more than me, repetition rarely hurts. 
	Also by actively participating in the internal discussions I could contribute towards the team in terms of learning.
	

	What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	Not very much this far, I’ve now read more about it since I didn’t know very much about the concept prior to this project.


	What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	I’ve participated in the brainstorming and given input and discussing pros and cons.


	

	Week 3, sprint 1.

	What do I want to learn or understand better?
	We’ve begun creating a UML diagram for our program. It came clear that I needed some repetition on that, 
	especially when it comes to what arrow every relation is represented by. 


	How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	By not being shy to give input on different ideas, helping to elaborate the team members’ thought and ideas. 
	Also it’s very important that each and everyone of us feels confident to speak up, therefore I try my best to contribute to a good atmosphere at our meetings.
	

	What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	To make sure that when we divide user stories into smaller tasks, we do so in smaller groups to increase time efficiency. By smaller groups I mean backend and frontend. 
	And afterwards ensure that everyone gets a say in everything, the group that divided a user story gives a quick run through of the task they have broken down so that everyone 		can share their opinion in case someone wants to change something.


	What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	I take notes from the meetings with our stakeholder and emphasize what he finds especially important and what he feels that we can cut off or focus less on.
	By getting it clear what we must prioritize I feel that we can deliver better.


	

	Week 4, Sprint 2.

	What do I want to learn or understand better?
	We talked about different KPIs and determined the ones we wanted to use. Hopefully this will help us to better understand how we work and how we can improve.


	How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	I struggled to get my compilator to stay up to date with git, so a team member helped adviced me to get vs code. He helped me to install java fx, 
	we experienced some troubles so I think both he and I learned some from it.


	What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	Perhaps by helping with time estimation for different tasks.

	
	What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	Again by taking notes from the meeting with our stakeholder, I also worked with some code in the relations’ class.


	

	Week 5, Sprint 3.

	What do I want to learn or understand better?
	In the backend group we talked about pathfinding for the arrows, one person mentioned aStar which I remember slightly from the algorithms and datastructures’ course. 
	It would be nice to get a better grip on search algorithms’ in general and particularly the aStar algorithm.

	
	How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	In the backend group this sprint’s tasks were quite advanced, I didn’t feel like I really could contribute on my own, at least in terms of code writing. 
	Therefore me and another one from the backend group made java documentation for the already existing code. 
	This raised some questions of how a few methods were intended to work. It felt like we had a good discussion about it. 
	Hopefully this will help the other team members to better understand the code, especially the ones from the frontend group.
	

	What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	By discussing with the group about what our stakeholder said, how we can implement it.


	What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	Again, I took notes from the Monday’s meeting with our stakeholder. Also the KPIs were brought up to discussion.
	Apart from that I didn’t contribute very much, as I had a lot to do with the bachelor’s thesis that I’m writing.




	Week 6, Sprint 4.

	What do I want to learn or understand better?
	This week, most of the time spent with the backend group went to refactorizing the relations’ class. While doing so we spoke a bit about complexity and scalability. 
	It would be rewarding for future projects to learn more about different solutions for that.
	

	How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	By bringing up questions about the refactoring, maybe others had the same questions but didn’t feel like asking the question.
	

	What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	Participating in our weekly meetings, doing the scrum poker, discussing what we’ve come up with and giving support wherever needed.


	What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	Refactoring the code, making it neater and more coherent. Also taking notes from our stakeholder again, which helped us narrow down our priorities.




	Week 7, Sprint 5.

	What do I want to learn or understand better?
	The pathfinding for the arrows. Even though I understand the basics and some implementations of aStar, this specific implementation would be nice to understand thoroughly. 
	Also from last week after refactoring the code we decided that I should come up with a draft of which relations we want to be “suggested” for each pair of boxes. 
	In order to do this I had to do some research on relations in UML-diagrams.
	

	How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	By sharing my findings on the relations for UML-diagrams. I feel like many of us only are confident and familiar with the most ordinary ones.
	

	What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	Filling in the KPIs, discussing our situation and what’s next to do.	


	What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	Doing the draft on the relation types, since it would save us alot of time if one of us comes up with a suggestion that the team can agree or disagree on, partly or completely. 

	


	Week 8, Sprint 6.

	What do I want to learn or understand better?
	I would like to learn some frameworks for presenting IT-projects. I already know some frameworks on pitching in general and we tried to implement some general ideas of it in 		the presentation.


	How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	During the creation of the presentation a few bugs were discovered, some of them new and some of them previously known by other team members. This brought attention to it so we 	could work it out.


	What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	Discussing the the meeting with our stakeholder, agreeing on that we should cut off the ”suggest arrow” function.	


	What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	This week the other I-student and I had our deadline for the bachelor’s thesis, so we were pretty stressed out. Like usually I took notes from the meeting with our stakeholder. 
	I participated in our other meetings, gave input and shared thoughts. I also created the presentation-demo together with another team member. 
	Prior to creating the presentation we discussed a lot within the group what we wanted to show and highlight in the presentation.
